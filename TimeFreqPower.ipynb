    "Recall that the Fourier transform at x Hz can be calculated by multiplying and then summing a cosine and a sine of x Hz to the signal of interest. This means that the power spectra we just calculated also could be derived by multiplying the cosine and sine to the data of each time window and calculating the respective sums (dot products). This can also be envisioned as multiplying a boxcar function to the data prior to calculating the Fourier transform. The boxcar is then moved one step forward. This is in effect the same a convolution in the discrete domain. Also recall that convolution in the time domain is the same as multiplication in the frequency domain. Thus we can qualitatively study the effect of the sliding (boxcar) time window by considering the power spectrum of the function cos(2 $\\pi$ f t) + i sin(2 $\\pi$ f t) where t are the time points of the window. This spectrum is informative for how the sliding time window affects the time-frequency estimate of power. We will do this for 9 Hz:"
